# Prediction of Road Accidents and Severity in Bangladesh Applying Machine Learning Techniques
The project titled "Prediction of Road Accidents and Severity in Bangladesh Applying Machine Learning Techniques" focuses on predicting road accidents and their severity using machine learning methods. It involves accident and severity classification, alongside comprehensive statistical analysis. The project employs Euclidean distance-based targeting and range calculation to analyse accident data effectively. Various supervised algorithms are applied to develop predictive models. The implementation is carried out in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, with Matplotlib used for data visualisation, enabling a clearer understanding of the patterns and factors contributing to road accidents in Bangladesh.
